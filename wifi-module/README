Do you want to update the kernel without issues
# Run first
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
sudo apt-get install subversion

After that you are able to install (the preffered mehod) .deb file


# DEB package install (the preffered method)
dpkg -i rtl8723bs-dkms_4.14_all.deb

# DKMS manual Install
copy rtl8723bs-4.14 to /usr/src/
dkms add -m rtl8723bs -v 4.14
dkms build -m rtl8723bs -v 4.14
dkms install -m rtl8723bs -v 4.14

# Last resort help, if dkms doesn't work
run fix-for-installed-kernel.sh
it will try to install the correct module before reboot
